mapbender.proxy - Mapbender\\CoreBundle\\Component\\ProxyService
################################################################

This service provides a generic proxy class which is for example
used in the proxy controller. This is cURL-based and will be replaced
by the OWSProxyBundles which are Buzz-based (which can use cURL, but
also other HTTP clients transparently)
